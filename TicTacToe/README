This is a simple TicTacToe game. You can play against another human or the computer (not implemented).
The victory screen is broken, I do not understand why.

This is my first game written in SDL.

Set your constants in the constants.h file.

Logger included, Linux+GNU specific.

Controls:
When in the game, press Q to quit, B to go back to the menu, N for a new game.
